First the scrapper to get data from "books to scrape" site, which uses SELENIUM, and saves them in a Books Folder.

2nd the Exceler, uses OPENPYXL to filter the data from the txts and make an Excel in the Data Excel Folder.
				(idr which saves to data excel, 2nd or 3rd, just excuete in order)
3rd the Filler, which uses RANDOM to make some fileds as the data from the website was minimal, in the data excel folder


4th Cleaner which uses Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook, this code isnt organaised you gotta read most of it to get the methodes,
Finally it outputs 3 excels in Output Excels:

1-Cleaned_data: all data + Authors Summary + books summary (sheets)

2-Authors summary: authors, total income, total no of books, contribution
